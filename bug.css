The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a common mistake when using it with percentages and other units. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 10%);` might not produce the intended result. Percentages in `calc()` are relative to the containing element's width, so subtracting a percentage from another percentage isn't straightforward.  This leads to unexpected widths.
